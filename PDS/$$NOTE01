A few notes about using the TRK0**** set of programs.

TRK0SAVE will back up the IPL text (if it exists) on a disk volume.
DCB attributes of the backup dataset are:

  RECFM=U,LRECL=0,BLKSIZE=32760

Each backed up Track 0 record will contain count, key, and data
fields.  See their description in the notes below.

A snippet of the beginning of the records for a pack containing
IPL text follows:  This is from a TRK0SAVE backup.

Note that record 3 is not backed up.  See where the * is, to note
the record number of the backed up record in hex.  This is in the
"count" field.

Description of backed up record format.....

    The format written by these program does NOT
  match what ICKDSF write IPLTEXT ABSFORMAT expects.

  ABSFORMAT wants three or more undefined records.
  The first must be 24 ( X'18' ) bytes.
  The second must be 144 ( X'90' ) bytes.
  The others are written after the volume label as is.

  These programs include count and key fields so:
  The first must be 36 bytes ( C+K+D 8+4+24 ).
  The second must be 156 bytes ( C+K+D 8+4+144 ).
  Others are eight bytes larger than data for the
  count field.

  The program TR02ABS can convert backed-up IPL text
  from TRK0SAVE format to ICKDSF ABS format.
