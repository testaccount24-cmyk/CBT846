My //STEPLIB was changed from SYS1.W$$.LINKLIB to SYS1.CBT.LINKLIB.

Please put these program load modules in your own APF-authorized
library.  You need APF-authorization to write data to Track 0 of
a disk pack.  This is because normal allocation will not work there,
and you have to change the DEB to point to Track 0, which requires
APF-authorization.  (See the code inside the programs.)
