  FUNCTION OF THIS PROGRAM:   ONLCLEAR

     For JCL to run ONLCLEAR, please see member ONLCLEA@.
     You can make a PROC out of this JCL, and clear all the
     VOL1 user areas on many (or all) the packs on your
     system (in a jiffy) - if you want to do that.

     As coded, to protect usage of this program, you need
     READ access to RACF FACILITY class TBCXTUL.  Same
     authority is needed for program ONLCLIP, which is also
     part of this file.

     THIS PROGRAM WAS DERIVED FROM THE ONLCLIP PROGRAM, BUT
     INSTEAD OF CHANGING THE DASD VOLSER, IT CLEARS THE USER
     IDENTIFICATION AREA OF THE DASD VOL1 RECORD TO BLANKS.

     PARMS IN THE JCL ARE IGNORED (unlike the ONLCLIP program).

     The user area of the VOL1 record for the disk pack is
     cleared out to all blanks.  (Track 0, Record 3. This is
     the last 64 bytes of Record 0, Track 3.)

     The DISKUPD DD name determines the volser to be changed.

     According to IBM nowadays (12/2020), the last 64 bytes of
     the Track 0, Record 3, VOL1 DASD id record, should be all
     blanks (X'40' EBCDIC).  This is what the ONLCLEAR program
     sets them to.

     These bytes are often used to identify the owner of the
     disk pack, or the creator of the disk pack.  In previous
     times, there may have been other uses for this data area.

  Examples of this data area from old disks and new disks.

  Example 1.  Disk pack created by a P/390.

  Example 2.  Disk pack which was old.  I don't understand
              the significance of the data.

  Example 3.  This is a "normal" volume.  Most DASD nowadays
              have a volume id record that looks like this.
