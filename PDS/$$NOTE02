Recent change to the ONLCLIP program.

The most recent change to the ONLCLIP program was a cosmetic
change, to put a comment at the beginning of the program, as
an eyecatcher, letting the installer know what kind of RACF
protection the program has.

In order to run the program with RACF protection, there needs
to be defined a FACILITY class profile, called TBCXTUL.  And
the program needs READ access to this profile.  The error
message in the program does not tell you the kind of RACF
protection which the program ONLCLIP has.  So we put an eye-
catcher at the beginning of the program, so that if you Browse
the load module, you can figure out the type of RACF protection
that is needed.

The following is a LISTMOD dump of the ONLCLIP module, to show
the eyecatcher:   (LISTMOD - TSO command - is on CBT File 994.)

In case the installer wants to bypass RACF protection completely,
there is a NOP instruction (currently at +200, but you have to
check the current source for the exact location), which can be
changed to a B (unconditional branch) instruction, and this will
completely bypass the RACROUTE instructions in the program.
So the 4700 at that location has to be changed to 47F0, and this
will bypass the RACF protection entirely.

You change the 4700 at +200 to 47F0.
